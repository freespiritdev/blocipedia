## Blocipedia: a Reddit clone of a SaaS Wiki Collaboration Tool

Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

== README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...

## Setup

Copy the "config/application.example.yml" file and remove "example". Your application.yml should contain your sensitive credentials. It should be included in .gitnore as well.


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
